"""Summarise rover runs (plan/stage1.md, 4.5): event counts, split detection, end-point error.

usage: summarize_run.py RUN_DIR [RUN_DIR ...]

Each RUN_DIR is a folder written by stereo_realsense_D435_rover (console.log, events.csv,
keyframes.txt). Prints one line per run, so every comparison is computed the same way.

End-point error: runs start on a floor mark, go round the loop, pass the mark again and end a
few metres further along the start of the route (ORB-SLAM3 confirms a loop only after
recognising the place in 3 consecutive new keyframes, so the camera must keep moving over the
start area). The error is the distance from the last keyframe to the nearest keyframe in the
first third of the route: after a correct loop closure the two passes lie on top of each other.
It is meaningful only when the run is not split (a new map that never merged back).
